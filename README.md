# site-sku-search
This is a simple application that allows you to load a CSV file containing a list of SKUs so you can quickly search for those SKUs on an e-commerce site by placing the SKU/search term in the URL of the search results.

It is currently a single HTML file, so a person should only have to open the HTML file in the browser to use the application.

Additional options can be added to the dropdown menu for stage and dev environments, if you can search via SKU in the URL for those environments.

It was built against the Coleman.com Site Search as I've been contracting with them since the beginning of May 2016.
